# IS 601 - Project 3

## Project Description
This project's goal was to use a REST API and use Postman to test the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE request methods.

The data was taken from [this](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html) csv source and converted to SQL statements using [this](https://sqlizer.io/#/) online tool.
